# roboCar
The directory includes programs that are executed by a robotic car.

The three main programs are:
 - line_follow.py (python script that makes the car follow a black line on the floor)
 - sumo_mode.py (python script that makes the car push objects out of an arena)
 - index.php (code for a web interface that allows the car to be controlled remotely).
 
For the execution of the python scripts, two modules were created:
 - Motors.py (contains methods to move the car in different directions)
 - LineSensors.py (contains methods that check which sensors detect something)
 
Different tests were also included in this repo.
